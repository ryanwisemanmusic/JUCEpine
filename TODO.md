Current list:
- Run additional tests in main.cpp and see what works, and what breaks our project
- Verify through secondary source that this runs in a Docker container on another machine, that there are no odd discrepancies within my APKBUILD
- Double check formatting, make sure we are busybox compliant and also meet the formatting specifications demanded by Alpine's devs.
- Submit to Alpine's Aports
