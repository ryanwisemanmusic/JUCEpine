Essentials for TODO:
- Make sure main.cpp supports our headers (it doesn't)

Finalization TODO:
- Shell test calls in bash to JUCE, ensure we can parse through all the headers and it reflects everything added
- Create desktop environment via QEMU and attempt to run JUCE
- Submit to Alpine Edge by cloining Edge, creating a branch, and then create a pull request
- Be willing to answer any emails about the code in question
- Publicize repos
