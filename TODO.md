Essentials for TODO:
- Make sure signature is trusted
- Make sure JUCE creates index
- Double check if this thing is fine: >>> juce: Uninstalling dependencies...
- Fix extremely concerning error: No such package: .makedepends-juce
- Check headers, ensure that each can be reached

Finalization TODO:
- Shell test calls in bash to JUCE, ensure we can parse through all the headers and it reflects everything added
- Create desktop environment via QEMU and attempt to run JUCE
- Submit to Alpine Edge by cloining Edge, creating a branch, and then create a pull request
- Be willing to answer any emails about the code in question
- Publicize repos
